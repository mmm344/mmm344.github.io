# Matthew McCoy, Ph.D.

Welcome! My name is Matthew McCoy and I am currently working as a Data Scientist/Consultant. I am always looking to explore new and interesting facets of data science and data engineering. I received my Ph.D. from the University of Missouri-Kansas City in the field of Mathematics with an emphasis in Physics. After transitioning to industry work, I realized that my skillset best pairs with data science/data engineering, where a passion for continual learning is a must-have skill. A friend of mine described consulting as "graduate school for adults" and I tend to agree. My hunger for knowledge and project-oriented mindset makes me an excellent fit for this type of work. Below are some projects I have worked on the demonstrate my passion for learning, problem-solving, and communcation of complex concepts. Enjoy!

# Sparking joy

A part of stepping into the world of "big data" is to pick a language and stick with it through thick and thin. For me, Python is just that. In this project, I used raw data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness), performed some data cleaning and [exploratory analysis](https://github.com/mmm344/python_playground/blob/main/spark_world_happiness.ipynb), regression analysis, and then k-means clustering to help understand socioeconomic factors. Enjoy!
